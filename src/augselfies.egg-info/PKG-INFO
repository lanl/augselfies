## augSELFIES
![coverage](https://lisdi-git.lanl.gov/asalij/augselfies/badges/main/coverage.svg?min_good=90&min_acceptable=75&min_medium=60)
Augmented implementation of a modified version of Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES).

The core distinction here is that while the original SELFIES implementation focuses on interconverting 
between SMILES and SELFIES strings with molecular graphs predominantly used as an afterthought, here
graphs and operations on them are at the forefront. Secondarily, native SELFIES re-uses chemical symbol tokens
for indexing, whereas this implementation supports alterative indexing schemes. 

For the original implmentation and references, see https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies.

# Installation 

First install pixi onto your machine. Next, while in a directory for augselfies, run

```bash 
pixi install 
```
to install default required dependencies and
```bash 
pixi shell 
```
from the root directory of this project to install the dependencies and to activate the envioronment.

# Usage 

augSELFIES should be used as a library, predominantly for data processing. 

It contains methods for converting SELFIES to numeric SELFIES (numSELFIES), implementations of 
which are in `augselfies.numeralization`. 

augSELFIES also contains processes for data augmentation, creating multiple equivalent SELFIES/numSELFIES for the some underlying
molcular graph. See `augselfies.augmentation` for details and implmentation. 

# Testing
